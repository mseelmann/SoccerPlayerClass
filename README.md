# SoccerPlayerClass

CS2 assignment that required a program that could read in data from a csv file and use it to create objects. The data in the csv describes information about soccer players (first name, last name, jersey number, position, team, captain status, and age) and was put in an ArrayList. A SoccerPlayer class with the corresponding attributes was created with a static id variable to assign each player their own personal id number. A Name class was created with the attributes first and last, and involved a check to verify that the name is a valid name. The SoccerPlayer class also involved a series of check methods to verify that the other attributes were appropriate for this problem. One of these checks involved reading in a list of valid team names (from teams.txt) to verify that the players had valid team names listed. The program first displays all the attributes of each player. Then, it displays a list of all the players on the team “Arsenal” organized in ascending jersey numbers.
